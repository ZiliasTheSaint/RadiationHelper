============================================================================================================
My intention is to give the user the complete freedom to use this software to create ANY kind of software,
i.e.free software AND/OR proprietary software and not only free software, provided that the terms in the attached license are met.
Basically a simple mention of copyright holder(s) in a notice file would suffice.

Using any software (e.g. MySQL connector) licensed under a copyleft license such as GNU GPL, no matter if it is used one line of 
code or more, inside (or linked to) the user own software, will force the user to give away its own source code, which means he 
can create only free software. Examples of non-copylefted licenses, i.e. permissive licenses, are: BSD License, Apache License 2.0, GNU LGPL, MIT License.

All licenses associated to all distributed libraries are permissive (see lib folder).
